# Hello, I'm Uli

I'm working as the VP of Engineering for APAC at [Vestiaire Collective](https://us.vestiairecollective.com/), based out of Singapore. I also teach at [NUS](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). Slides from my talks, featured projects and my AI research are on [API Geek](https://apigeek.net/). You can get in touch with me via [LinkeIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uhitzel/).
