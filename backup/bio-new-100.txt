Uli grew up in Johannes Gutenberg's neighborhood â€” you could say it was the Silicon Valley of the 15th century. He usually doesn't have a beard but he shares the same passion for everything at the intersection of technology, content, design & repeatability.

Previously with companies including Microsoft, Red Hat, Yahoo! and IBM, Uli is now helping Axway customers build innovative, data-driven platforms using state-of-the-art building blocks for API Management, data integration, and analytics.
