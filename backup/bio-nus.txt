Uli has been working with data engineering & distributed systems since the early days of the internet. Previously with companies including Microsoft, Red Hat, Yahoo! and IBM, he now works at Axway where he is helping customers create innovative, data-driven platforms using state-of-the-art building blocks for API Management, data integration, and analytics.

He studied computer science and electrical engineering in Germany, after growing up in Johannes Gutenberg's neighborhood â€” you could say it was the Silicon Valley of the 15th century. Now, Uli usually doesn't have a beard but he shares the same passion for everything at the intersection of technology, content, design & repeatability.

On the technical side Uli works with automation, API design, Linux engineering, Python, NoSQL databases, containerized workloads & microservices, messaging systems, and DevOps.
