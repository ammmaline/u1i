Uli grew up in Johannes Gutenberg's neighborhood â€” you could say it was the Silicon Valley of the 15th century. He usually doesn't have a beard but he shares the same passion for everything at the intersection of technology, content, design & repeatability. 

As an API Evangelist & Developer Advocate, Uli helps strategic accounts build exciting use cases around API & HIP, turn them into success stories and ultimately, convert our customers into Axway fans.

Living in Asia since 8 years, Uli was previously working in a Presales role at Axway and with companies including Microsoft, Red Hat, Yahoo! and IBM prior to that.
