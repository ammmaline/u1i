Uli has been working with data engineering & distributed systems since the early days of the internet. Previously with companies including Microsoft, Red Hat, Yahoo! and IBM, he has now switched sides to look at the things from an end-user perspective. Building a digital healthcare platform in times of a pandemic and launching an e-commerce platform in South Korea are just some of the projects Uli has been working on recently. He is the founder at Electric Minds, where he is looking to combine machine intelligence with human ingenuity to inspire new ways of thinking and solve some of the most challenging problems we face as a global society today. Since 2020 he also teaches at the National University of Singapore.
